# Airbnb_Project
Analysis of NY's Airbnb data from 2019 to 2020 containing a price prediction model.
Throughout this report we explore the impact of Covid-19 on New York's Airbnb listings.
The data used was provided by InsideAirbnb.
We then produce a price prediction model for first-time Airbnb hosts to help such hosts gain an idea of where to price their listing.
