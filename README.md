# Airbnb_Project
Analysis of NY's Airbnb data from 2019 to 2020 containing a price prediction model.
This project was completed for our Strategy Analytics module as part of the Msc Business Analytics programme at UCL.
The data used throughout the report was extracted from InsideAirbnb and encompasses New York's Aibnb data from 2019 and 2020
First, we explore how Covid-19 impacted Airbnb listings in NY by looking at changes in key performance indicators.
Then, we create a price prediction model to be used by first-time hosts as a potential feature for Airbnb to adapt using Gradient Boosting.
